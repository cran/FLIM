\description{The PANSS or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of patients with schizophrenic conditions.	\code{panss} contains data from a longitudinal study where 3 different treatments were considered. Patients were followed for 8 weeks and PANSS score was recorded on week 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8. The lower PANSS score a patient has, the less symptoms. Data was extracted from a larger, and confidential, set of clinical trial data from a randomised clinical trial.
